# ApplNumComp
Applied Numerical Computing Course

This repository contains a set of lessons on Applied Numerical Computing covering Git for version control, LaTeX for typesetting, and MATLAB and Python for high-level programming and scientific computing. 

Note: this site is in progress during the synchronous Fall 2020 course offering.
