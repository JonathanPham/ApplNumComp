Unknown Speaker  0:01  
Okay, so this is my test of live streaming and class. video recording right now just chrome on my computer. And here is chrome at full screen sharing. Just a Chrome app at full resolution on my computer. So wanting to demonstrate

Unknown Speaker  0:39  
that

Unknown Speaker  0:43  
I'm sitting in front of my computer with my own. With my mouse gone, obviously, and trying to demonstrate that I can have students see screen, I am seated in front of my own webcam so online students could hear me and see me and see the same streaming content through zoom that the in person students can see I have a mask on. I also have my night guard in. So that's affecting my voice.

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
This is my normal voice and I can amplify it

Unknown Speaker  1:42  
This is me recording for the computer sake through the computer audio

Unknown Speaker  1:53  
on can see MATLAB online. I'm also going to check for the purposes of question

Unknown Speaker  2:04  
audio quality has not yet switched.

Unknown Speaker  2:29  
Okay, so now I have the new headphones. Now I have the new headphones in. And so this is a test of using the headset for in class audio while I'm seated in front of the computer so that those who are online can hear now I think the complication of this arrangement is that you won't be able to hear what the other students in the classroom say. So this may be ideal for in person recording. Single recording, but not for the live streaming option. So I'm going to explore without this for the remainder of this video.

Unknown Speaker  3:26  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  3:34  
Sounds good. All right. So

Unknown Speaker  3:38  
this is the demonstration of

Unknown Speaker  3:44  
MATLAB running students can see it. Nice size. Some solution like MATLAB live that I had posted last year. Okay. We can also navigate to course announcements, course materials. I had organized these modules last year into

Unknown Speaker  4:17  
certain electronic content,

Unknown Speaker  4:21  
videos, just HTML. So they are visible. There is a PDF version that could be read through, hopefully, we're going to make that compatible with a PDF reader. And then the HTML hopefully would also be accessible by screen reader, but we're going to check that content and number of links, we're going to talk about these later. Okay, so So what else I want to test in this space. Now I'm going to switch my video

Unknown Speaker  5:10  
and do rear camera.

Unknown Speaker  5:14  
So I'm able to view the classroom stops sharing. So if I was wanting to see my students in the room and give them the opportunity to speak, and I'm going to have a room that is definitely at least half of the size. And so with careful angling and movement of this camera, so I'm going to test a few locations as far as distance from this computer screen and hear the amplification

Unknown Speaker  5:58  
whether this computer can pick up

Unknown Speaker  6:13  
So

Unknown Speaker  6:24  
not sure if I burn

Unknown Speaker  6:28  
if I'm in the classroom right now everyone hear me walk

Unknown Speaker  6:35  
out the other side wall too.

Unknown Speaker  6:41  
So can at this volume everyone in this room

Unknown Speaker  6:55  
anywhere else, other doors

Unknown Speaker  6:59  
mine rebuilding work is no bigger than this.

Unknown Speaker  7:08  
So again, and then the normal speaking volume

Unknown Speaker  7:12  
and volume that I normally put up projected in this particular room

Unknown Speaker  7:17  
with a mask on, but nobody's

Unknown Speaker  7:23  
coming closer

Unknown Speaker  7:26  
on the front row on the camera shot but the front row of the middle section of this classroom

Unknown Speaker  7:35  
coming in

Unknown Speaker  7:37  
now I'm on the front row

Unknown Speaker  7:42  
within hands touch of the computer so you can hear what it's like same volume in this location. The move to the side and hearing students being within this angle of me but I'm about 12 feet

Unknown Speaker  8:02  
This classroom

Unknown Speaker  8:06  
lecture is movable.

Unknown Speaker  8:13  
So this is about

Unknown Speaker  8:16  
six or so feet away from the computer. thing. One

Unknown Speaker  8:24  
another test this distance 123 steps back.

Unknown Speaker  8:32  
This the students on two, three steps back,

Unknown Speaker  8:39  
classroom building more

Unknown Speaker  8:45  
with wide angle

Unknown Speaker  8:48  
it also is flat,

Unknown Speaker  8:50  
elevation and once again students ever

Unknown Speaker  9:17  
All from the

Unknown Speaker  9:21  
rear camera. At this point I'm switching back to the front facing camera. So in this test I want to assess Can I hear the students? If they asked me a question while I'm recording either sharing a screen or sharing this I'm going to share the full screen. So this is not just Google Chrome, but this is a comparison with full screen mode. And for the sake of being able to show that I move over that I've got other stuff going on. So Sharing, I'm amplifying a capturing my video through chrome or through the front camera, the camera that faces user. I'm going to check the audio in the room as if students want to interrupt me Or ask a question in real time. So here I am standing in front of the computer screen. In class, I'm probably going to need to make sure that you can see me I may sit down but I will probably stand because I tend to not sit during class.

Unknown Speaker  10:37  
Here's the audio.

Unknown Speaker  10:39  
So to the side, about six feet away,

Unknown Speaker  10:45  
sorry, about 10 feet away.

Unknown Speaker  10:53  
Directly in front of the computer, about six or seven feet away.

Unknown Speaker  11:00  
123 steps back

Unknown Speaker  11:04  
and then the aisle between the two columns

Unknown Speaker  11:08  
123 steps back

Unknown Speaker  11:13  
123 steps back on the back row is the sponsor

Unknown Speaker  11:21  
coordinador

Unknown Speaker  11:26  
so I'm

Unknown Speaker  11:29  
as far back as Western

Unknown Speaker  11:32  
This was simulating simulated pretty much instructed that bad

Unknown Speaker  11:41  
boys. This is the water kind of boys raising my boys

Unknown Speaker  11:48  
and boys

Unknown Speaker  12:03  
Middle of the night bro moving over

Unknown Speaker  12:11  
the this is the second file in this classroom in the MFC with everyone hear me

Unknown Speaker  12:21  
going to the extreme edge of this classroom This is wider than my room in the north but I've got a computer in the way I've got further distance in this space away from my computer at slightly more louder than normal but mostly normal everyone in this room hear me and non surgical mask is not really impeding my articulation that much them

Unknown Speaker  12:59  
all right soundcheck

Unknown Speaker  13:02  
so I've checked the sound audio quality from different locations at the extremities of this room.

Unknown Speaker  13:18  
I'm going to do one more check coming down that other aisle to represent different depths on the right side of my classroom in question one. So far aisle, rolling chairs facing the computer.

Unknown Speaker  13:37  
123 steps 5123 steps back

Unknown Speaker  13:45  
123 steps back on the back row in the aisle further away from the podium. No have very little visibility Do a password standing.

Unknown Speaker  14:27  
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:36  
So, screen sharing that looks fine audio check has completed. I think image quality is fine for me being in here. We're going to check in the recording the captioning

Unknown Speaker  14:57  
check captioning

Unknown Speaker  15:01  
And the image

Unknown Speaker  15:05  
quality

Unknown Speaker  15:07  
and the audio

Unknown Speaker  15:10  
quality.

Unknown Speaker  15:12  
I'm also going to just as a quick check while recording, check myself in the sound settings for

Unknown Speaker  15:25  
youtube so I want to share

Unknown Speaker  15:29  
also my

Unknown Speaker  15:33  
audio so

Unknown Speaker  15:40  
I'm not sure the share

Unknown Speaker  15:43  
screen fullscreen

Unknown Speaker  15:46  
on share computer sound

Unknown Speaker  15:53  
the screen for sharing a video clip

Unknown Speaker  16:00  
So, let's go over Let's be amused.

Unknown Speaker  16:25  
We are the ones who would be the leaders. And look at what we've done already. I did

Unknown Speaker  16:29  
this I've never get this setting.

Unknown Speaker  16:34  
Did you try to

Unknown Speaker  16:39  
have anything new women department chairs now? I don't Something happened with Susan's pictures bigger than the I don't know. I think it's um

Unknown Speaker  16:54  
I think I must have done that in the back. I don't know how that worked out.

Unknown Speaker  17:02  
I am screen

Unknown Speaker  17:06  
recording.

Unknown Speaker  17:09  
I cancel that because there are some pages here. Exit

Unknown Speaker  17:18  
let's reload the screen.

Unknown Speaker  17:30  
This time I'm going to share the screen and when I do so I'm going to click on only the options for sharing me tired screen. I'm going to try again this optimized screen sharing for video clip

'''
code segment
'''

Unknown Speaker  18:15  
We are the ones should be the leaders and look at what we've done already. I have been just blown away this year all the numbers of new winning department chairs now I don't see the picture.

Unknown Speaker  18:28  
Okay, this video right now is not at the resolution of

Unknown Speaker  18:33  
the classroom computer at that resolution, the resolution of I would like it to be

Unknown Speaker  18:40  
in the context of your speech.

Unknown Speaker  18:44  
Okay, I don't know if this is the optimized or the bigger,

Unknown Speaker  18:50  
blurry, so we're going to stop sharing it with that setting. I have not tried to do this before. Allow us to do in this video series that is going to be online. Synchronous.

Unknown Speaker  19:22  
Kevin says a big one for lab if you're blind, the Italian lab because of the smell,

Unknown Speaker  19:27  
and whatever to say that kid your kid is amazing kid and you can tell his genuine is genuine. He is hardworking.

Unknown Speaker  19:40  
What was their diamond in the rough
