# **Lecture 2:LaTeX basics**

This lecture focuses on LaTeX for typesetting.

## **LaTeX download and installation**
To run LaTeX on a computer, you need to install both the LaTeX implementation (MikTeX or MacTeX) AND an editor. 
Some editors come with the implementation, but TeXMaker is preferred because of its layout and formatting.

* [overleaf.com](overleaf.com) is an online editor option that also exists (sort of like Google Docs for LaTeX). 
  However, it is preferred to install LaTeX on your own computer.

  1. Install MikTeX
    * [MikTex download](https://miktex.org/download) Select the tab for your operating system and follow the step by step tutorial if 
     you want more guidance. Note: during the installation there should be an option to 
     "set Install missing packages on the fly". Selecting "Yes" is helpful.
    * If you are a Mac user and this does not work well for you, [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) is another alternative
  2. Install TexMaker
    * [TexMaker download](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) click on the appropriate download link for your       operating system.
      After it has downloaded run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
