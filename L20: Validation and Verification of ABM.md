### **Validation and Verification**
  * Definitions
    * Validation
    * Verification
    * The difference between the two and importance of each
      * Validation is ensuring model works correctly the way it is expected to
      * Verification ensures model is useful beyond the data used to develop it.
  * Case Studies
    * [Reading 9](/RecommendedReading.md) has some very good examples
    * [Software Testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-verification-and-validation/) has a good definition of the difference
### **Agent Based Models**
* [Case study](https://github.com/ashleefv/BeeNestABM)
 * Consider ABM and explain what agent-based models are, some of their uses and powers
  * Allow for tracking of unique items in simulation, allowing statistical analytics to be performed
* [Introduction to ABM](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/Intro%20to%20ABM.pdf)
 * Shows good walkthrough of ABM
* [AiCHe Bee Presentation](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/AIChE%20Bee%20pres%20ANFV.pdf)
 * Powerpoint which explains in further depth development and uses of the Case study simulation
