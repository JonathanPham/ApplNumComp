# **Lesson 21: Agent Based Models and Open Source Software**
This lesson focuses on agent based models (ABM) and open source software.

### **Introductory Videos**
 * [Examples of open source software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60tMapC53Sw&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=AshleeN.FordVersypt)
    * [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/60tMapC53Sw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60tMapC53Sw "")
#### **Comprehension Check**
   * Do you have any experience with validation or verification of computer models?
   * Can you think of an example relevant to your field that is similar to the examples provided by the students in the video?
    * [Software Testing](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-verification-and-validation/) has a good definition of the difference
### **Agent Based Models**
* [Case study](https://github.com/ashleefv/BeeNestABM)
 * Consider ABM and explain what agent-based models are, some of their uses and powers
  * Allow for tracking of unique items in simulation, allowing statistical analytics to be performed
* [Introduction to ABM](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/Intro%20to%20ABM.pdf)
* ABM [Bee Example](https://github.com/ashleefv/BeeNestABM)
* [AIChE Bee Presentation](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/AIChE%20Bee%20pres%20ANFV.pdf)
 * Powerpoint that explains in further depth development and uses of the case study simulation
### **Open Source Software Examples**
* This lesson is very focused on open source software and as a result the introductory video is more in depth to provide more power to this lesson
