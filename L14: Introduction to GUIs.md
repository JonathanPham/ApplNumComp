# **Introduction to GUIs and MATLAB Capabilities**
Graphical User Interfaces, or GUIs, are everywhere in our world. 
This lesson introduces this topic and an overview of the MATLAB functionality in creating them therein.

#### **Comprehension Check**
 * Have you encountered GUIs for scientific or engineering applications for research or classes? If so, which one(s)?
### **Introduction to GUIs**
* Examples of GUIs in everyday life- student examples can be very good, ask them all to provide an example of a GUI they interact with regularly
* Use of each of the following websites to demonstrate functionality; includes 2 walkghrough examples from Mathworks
  * [Examples of MATLAB App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/ways-to-build-matlab-guis.html)
  * [Example of MATLAB GUIDE](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/about-the-simple-guide-gui-example.html)
