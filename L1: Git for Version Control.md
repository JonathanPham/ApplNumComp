# **Lecture 1:**

This lecture focuses on Git for version control.

### **Pre-Class assignments and Activities**
Create an account on bitbucket.org with you @okstate.edu email account. [substitute your individual university here]
It is strongly recommended that you set your username to the part of your email address that precedes the @ sign.

[Download and install Git following the instructions posted here.](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

Create two empty folders on your computer that are completely dedicated to tracking your computational assignments and synchronous class activities. Don't put other class files or personal files in these folders. Also, don't put one of these folders inside the other.

* Folder 1: name it FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to your own name) [ApplNumComp is a shortened reference to our course name]
You will control everything in this folder and submit your homework through this folder.

* Folder 2: name it CHEclassFa20
In class activity files will be shared in this folder. Dr. Ford Versypt will control this shared folder.  

* Create a Bitbucket repository, this will be where you turn in your homeworks. It is recommended to name it the same as this first folder you created on your local device.

[Here is an explanatory video on creating Bitbucket account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KS6TaJPeHo&feature=emb_title)

Link these repositories to Bitbucket

[See this walkthrough for linking to Bitbucket repositories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euEwNW4v82M&feature=emb_title)

### **Synchronous Session Outline**
**Questions from the pre-class activities?
**Demo with CHEclassFa20 folder

#### Activity
  In your bitbucket.org account with your @okstate.edu email account, go to your repository named FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to your own name). You should have created this repository in the pre-class activities.
  Setup the repository to have a local directory on your personal computer and connect the local directory to the online repository.  
  
  Create a new subfolder called Practice.
  Add any document or image file (preferably a small file) to the Practice folder.
  Get this file into your FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp repository on bitbucket
