# **Lecture 1:**

This lecture focuses on Git for version control.

### **Github and Bitbucket Setup**
Create an account on bitbucket.org with individual university email. 
It is strongly recommended to set the username to the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign. ex: if university email is duncabm@okstate.edu, use duncabm as the bitbucket username.

[Download and install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

Create two empty folders on the computer that are completely dedicated to tracking personal computational assignments and synchronous class activities. Don't put other class files or personal files in these folders. Also, don't put one of these folders inside the other.

* Folder 1: name it FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to own name) [ApplNumComp is a shortened reference to our course name]
Students will control everything in this folder and submit their homework through this folder.

* Folder 2: name it CHEclassFa20 [this folder is how to share coursenotes, examples, problems, etc.]
In class activity files will be shared in this folder. Course instructor will control this shared folder.  

* Create a Bitbucket repository, this will be where stduents turn in their homeworks. It is recommended to name it the same as the first folder created on the local device.

### **Try this Activity**

**Demo with CHEclassFa20 folder

#### Activity
  In personal bitbucket.org account created with personal email account, go to the repository named FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to own name). This should have been created previously.
  Setup the repository to have a local directory on personal computer and connect the local directory to the online repository.

  Create a new subfolder called Practice.
  Add any document or image file (preferably a small file) to the Practice folder.
  Get this file into your FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp repository on bitbucket
